The Hi-FiLES code has been designed to work on multi-CPU as well as multi-CPU-GPU platforms. The Flux Reconstruction method in its current form with explicit time-stepping has a great potential for parallelization. Since the solution points are not explicitly shared between elements, most of the computations are element-local enabling an efficient use of shared memory on GPUs. Also, several computations are independent for each solution point and the highly parallelizable nature of GPUs becomes very useful. A detailed description of the paralleization of the FR method, along with scalability and performance analysis has been performed in \cite{castonguay2011}.

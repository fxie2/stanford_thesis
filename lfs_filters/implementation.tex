\section{Implementation of LFS filters in HiFiLES}
\label{sec:implementation}
Following the work of Asthana et al. \cite{asthana2014}, filter kernels that are implemented are sharp spectral, Gaussian, and box.

After each iteration, individual elements in HiFiLES are checked for non-smoothness or abnormailities using Sheshadri's \cite{sheshadri2014shock} shock detection method. The final version will include a brief description of this method as implemented in HiFiLES.

The finding of the entries in matrix $\tilde{G}$ for individual elements will be described in the final version.

A regular matrix multiplication as shown in Equation \eqref{eqn:filtmat} is performed on the elements that were labeled by the shock detection method as problematic.

An analysis of operational complexity of the final implementation will be presented in the final version.

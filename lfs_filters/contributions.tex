\section{Contributions to the state of the art}
The study being started will provide insights into the compromise between the added computational effort and the potential accuracy gains in LES with SGS modeling that derive from high-order boundary representation. Additionally, the implementation of SGS modeling in a flux reconstruction code  would display and test the scheme's capability to be used in realistic aerospace design.

\chapter{HiFiLES: an open source GPU-powered, High-Order Large-Eddy Simulation code}
\chaptermark{HiFiLES: open source High-Order, LES code}

%Describe the history, structure, and capabilities of HiFiLES. Compile data from the 2014 AIAA paper.

%\subsection{History}
%Mention the work of the original SD++ developers and initial intention.
%
%Describe the process of transforming an academic code into an open source code that could be developed by the academic community at large.
%
%Describe differences between HiFiLES and other open source high-order codes, including PyFR.
%
%\subsection{Structure}
%Design decisions and object-oriented programming. 
%
%Describe the classes present in the code (even though the foundations of the code were developed by previous lab members, the developers' guide and readability has been improved by current lab members).
%
%Data structures and GPU/CPU implementation. Place references to Castonguay's and Williams's theses.
%
%\subsection{Capabilities}
%Point to all publications that contain results from HiFiLES/SD++
%
%Large-Eddy Simulation developments. Point to research by Lodato and Bull.

\section{Pyramidal Elements in Flux Reconstruction}

\subsection{Introduction}
Mention how it is done in regular DG methods and other high-order methods.

\subsection{The Flux Reconstruction Approach in a General Element}
Describe the Flux Reconstruction Approach in a general element. Borrow from AIAA paper on pyramids.

Cite work on Triangles and Tetrahedra by Williams and Castonguay.

\subsection{Finding the Correction Functions for Pyramids}
Mention that linear stability is not guaranteed, but how it can be ``promoted".

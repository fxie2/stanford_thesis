\chapter{Local Fourier Spectral Filters}
%We propose the use of Local Fourier-Spectral (LFS) filters, developed originally for 1-D and 2-D tensor-product elements by Asthana and LÃ³pez-Morales [cite], as a parameter-free approach to stabilize high-order solutions. The LFS filters stabilize the solution, when needed, under all potential modes of failure. Their formulation adapts easily to Finite-Element-based spatial discretizations: the filter has a compact stencil, is not more expensive than a solution evaluation, and is discretization-agnostic. We present solutions to turbulent, transonic, and supersonic flows using the Flux Reconstruction approach, a high-order scheme heavily studied in the Aerospace Computing Laboratory. All solutions are obtained in coarse, unstructured grids using a medium-cost multi-GPU-powered workstation.

%\subsection{Introduction}
%Mention that author was seeking filters that could be posed as a matrix-vector multiplication with a local stencil. Inspiration came from paper by Lodato.
%
%\subsection{Non-linear stabilization of high-order Flux Reconstruction schemes}
%Present summary of paper by Asthana et al. and key results.
%
%\subsection{1-D and 2-D tensor product element filtering approach}
%Describe original approach by Asthana et al. to filtering: basis functions outside element of interest are defined as constants in 1-D, and extruded curves and constants in 2-D.
%
%\subsection{Extension to arbitrary elements}
%Describe how filtering matrix is composed of two submatrices: square matrix that modifies the spectrum (energetic content) of the solution, and rectangular matrix that ensures the filter is Essentially Local Extremum Diminishing.
%
%The formulation of this type of filter is agnostic to the type of element and basis functions used, and provides a framework to design new LFS.

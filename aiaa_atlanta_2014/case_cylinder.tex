\subsection{Circular Cylinder}

The classic test case of laminar flow past a circular cylinder at low \gls{re} number has also been chosen as a verification and validation case for the 2D \gls{ns} equations in \gls{hf}, and the results are compared to existing experimental data and simulation results~\cite{park1998}. Two separate cases are computed: first, the steady flow past the cylinder at \gls{re}$= 20$, and second, the unsteady flow past the cylinder at \gls{re}$= 100$, where \gls{re} is based upon the diameter of the cylinder. For both cases, \gls{ma} number is set to 0.1 in order to recover nearly incompressible flow for comparisons with the existing incompressible results. The remaining flow conditions are $0\degr$ angle of attack, a constant ratio of specific heats of $1.4$, a Prandtl number of $0.72$, a free-stream temperature of $300K$, and a free-stream dynamic viscosity of $1.853\cdot 10^{-5} Pa \cdot s$ (laminar viscosity varies according to Sutherland's law during the simulation).

The two simulations are performed with third order polynomials on a mesh with $4988$ total elements that contains quadrilateral elements near the body of the cylinder and triangular elements out to the far-field. There is a small refinement box immediately downstream of the cylinder to help resolve features in the wake. The rectangular far-field boundaries are located approximately 30 diameters away from the cylinder in the upstream, upward, and downward directions and 50 diameters away in the downstream direction. A view of the mesh near the cylinder surface is show in Fig.~\ref{cylinder_1}.

The flow around the cylinder for \gls{re}$= 20$ is steady, and it features a large recirculation region behind the cylinder. Fig.~\ref{cylinder_1} presents x-velocity contours around the cylinder along with streamlines. The length of the recirculation region can be determined from the streamlines, and a length of approximately one cylinder diameter agrees well with reported results for \gls{re}$= 20$. The coefficient of drag computed by \gls{hf} is $2.043$, which is close to the value of $2.01$ reported by Park et al.~\cite{park1998} Pressure contours around the cylinder are shown in Fig.~\ref{cylinder_2}.

When \gls{re} is increased to $100$, the flow around the cylinder becomes unsteady and exhibits periodic vortex shedding. This periodic shedding in the wake behind the cylinder can be seen in the instantaneous contours of x-velocity and vorticity in Fig.~\ref{cylinder_3}, and it also results in periodic fluctuations in the force coefficients on the cylinder. \gls{hf} reports an average drag coefficient of $1.339$ with a maximum deviation from this value of $0.0092$, which agree excellently with the values reported by Park et al.~\cite{park1998} of $1.33$ and $0.0091$ for the average $C_d$ and maximum deviation from it, respectively.  Instantaneous pressure contours for the \gls{re}$= 100$ case can be seen in Fig.~\ref{cylinder_2}. The asymmetry that is visible in the pressure contours contributes to the variability in the drag coefficient.

\subsection{NACA 0012 airfoil at 0$\degr$ angle of attack, Re = 6 million, Ma = 0.15}
In this section, the NACA 0012 airfoil is used to study the accuracy of the \gls{sa} turbulence model coupled with \gls{fr}. The NACA 0012 is commonly used as a validation case for all turbulence models and a large database of results are available at the NASA Turbulence Modeling Resource website. A $6,539$ element quad/triangle mixed mesh is used with a NACA 0012 airfoil of chord length $1.0$ and a farfield boundary $20$ chord lengths away. The results are compared with CFL3D and experimental results from Gregory \& O'Reilly~\cite{gregory1973low}.
